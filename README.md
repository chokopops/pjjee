Create a database with "adm" password and "adm" login which will be defined in the class "constant".
To launch the project, you will need to run the sql commands in the "create.sql" file to insert the tables. Then you will need to execute the commands of the file "insert.sql" to get the content of your database.
Don't forget to put in the "constant" class the name of your database and its drivers.
You can launch your application after you have done all this.
